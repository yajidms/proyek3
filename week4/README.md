## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:


 Akademik web app with Laravel 12, Bootstrap 5, PostgreSQL, JWT, and role-based access using spatie/laravel-permission.

 Setup

 - Copy .env.example to .env and ensure:
	 - DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
	 - DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
	 - DB_PORT=
	 - DB_DATABASE=
	 - DB_USERNAME=
	 - DB_PASSWORD=
	 - JWT_SECRET=your-very-strong-secret
 - composer install
 - php artisan key:generate
 - php artisan migrate
 - php artisan db:seed
 - npm install
 - npm run dev
 - php artisan serve

 Default accounts

 - Admin: admin@example.com / password
 - Student: student@example.com / password

 Features

 - Session login for Blade pages
 - Role-based routes and menus (admin, student)
 - Admin: CRUD courses, manage users (activate/deactivate, set role)
 - Student: view courses, enroll
 - API: POST /api/login => JWT HS256; GET /api/profile, /api/courses with Authorization: Bearer <token>

 Security

 - JWT decoding whitelists algorithm HS256 via firebase/php-jwt Key
